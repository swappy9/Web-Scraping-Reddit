I will show you how to use the reddit public API to retrieve data in .CSV format from the subreddit /r/relationships based on subreddit name, although this technique will translate to both the reddit mainpage and other subreddits.

# Requirements
- Reddit application account to get the account credentails for the app.
- Python 3 installed/ python jupyter notebook
- Following python libraries :- requests, json, config, praw, csv, sys, datetime, pandas
- Config.py file contains the account credentials which is masked in the above file - you need to replace it with your credentials
